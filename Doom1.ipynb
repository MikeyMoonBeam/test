    "# Is 1 in 5 Italians really involved in the gig economy?\n",

    "## A question from the floor...\n",
    "\n",
    "At a recent presentation in rome I presented the results form FEPS Digital Footprint study. Part of this study highlight the prevalence of labour in the gig economy in 7 European Countries, the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. One of the responses I got was that the number of Italians that had engaged in paid work in the gig economy was far too high to be credible.  The gross number was roughly 21%, and one of the attendees stood up and asked me “Is this real?”. I recovered quite well, but in hindsight I didn’t defend our research as eloquently as I should have been. No research is perfect, and there are several issues that could bias the data, and I will go over them later. First let me go over the claims though.  The analysis of the Italian data can be found below:\n"
