    "\n",
    "At a recent presentation in rome I presented the results form FEPS Digital Footprint study. Part of this study highlight the prevalence of labour in the gig economy in 7 European Countries, the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. One of the responses I got was that the number of Italians that had engaged in paid work in the gig economy was far too high to be credible.  The gross number was roughly 21%, and one of the attendees stood up and asked me “Is this real?”. I recovered quite well, but in hindsight I didn’t defend our research as eloquently as I should have been. No research is perfect, and there are several issues that could bias the data, and I will go over them later. First let me go over the claims though.  The analysis of the Italian data can be found below:\n"

They have comparable numbers in terms of people searching and finding crowdwork, although the Italian sample *does* have a slightly higher proportion of crowdworkers, but this difference is not one that is particularly dramatic. However, in terms of *frequency* of performing these sorts of jobs, Italy's numbers are still quite high. However, it would be difficult to notch these differences down to language issues, as you would then expect these 4 countries to be more similar than they are. \n",
